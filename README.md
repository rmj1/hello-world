<h1>hello-world</h1>
<p>Hello, wonderful world. I'm tapped out for advancement in my current position and motivated to become a programmer. Web development interests me initially as I dabbled in it during the late 90's.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>To date, I've studied HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Next on my hit list are Python and Ruby ... open to any suggestions. Machine learning interests me as well, but right now I'm working on building a firm foundation.</p>

<h2>Methods of Learning</h2>
The Odin Project, Codecademy, DASH (through General Assembly), and Lynda.com. My company provides a subscription to Lynda; it's been more helpful than I expected from a conventional, main-stream source. 

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Learn computer science, programming, development, etc.</li>
  <li>Identify what area(s) I get fired up about</li>
  <li>Round out education</li>
  <li>Career change</li>
  <li>Never stop learning</li>
  </ol>
